## 📁 Datacamp Projects

This repository includes several SQL projects I worked on while learning SQL through [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/). These projects helped me understand how to write and apply SQL queries using real-world datasets.

Each project folder contains:
- A `.pdf` file with the original code view from DataCamp.  
- A `workspace` folder that includes the notebook version of the project and some related visuals.

A few projects are still in progress — I’ll be adding them here soon via new commits.

### 📌 Projects completed so far:

1. **Analyzing Electric Vehicle Charging Habits**  
   Querying EV charging data to explore user behavior.

2. **Factors that Fuel Student Performance**  
   Using SQL to find what influences students' academic success.

3. **Impact Analysis of GoodThought NGO Initiatives**  
   Studying the effectiveness of social initiatives through data.

4. **Uncovering the World's Oldest Businesses**  
   Looking into long-running businesses using SQL filters and aggregations.

5. **When Was the Golden Era of Video Games**  
   Finding trends in video game history through release data.

🧠 I'm still learning — this repo is part of my SQL learning journey and will be updated as I continue.

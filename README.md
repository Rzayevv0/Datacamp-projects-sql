# SQL Projects â€“ DataCamp Learning Journey  

This repository includes several SQL projects I worked on while learning SQL through **DataCamp**. These projects helped me strengthen my understanding of writing and applying SQL queries on real-world datasets.  

Each project folder contains:  
- A **.pdf file** with the original code view from DataCamp.  
- A **workspace folder** that includes the notebook version of the project and some related visuals.
